DE Analysis with DESeq2 between a group infected with COVID-19 and a healthy CONTROL group.

COVID - 19 has emerged to be a defining challenge in various aspects of our life in the last year. An increasing amount of studies about the long term effects of exposure to the virus start to alert the public of the concerning consequences of infection to human health. As of 2021, most people are aware of the potential harms of infection with regards to the long term effects on the respiratory system and the brain. Incidents of heart problems after infection have shown the need to explore this relationship: Heart injury has been reported in up to 25 percent of COVID-19 patients, yet the cause of myocardial histopathology is unknown. To contribute, this study investigates the correlation of SARS-CoV2 and heart damage caused by an over-reaction of macrophages present at the heart.



# Data
The six public samples published by Yang et al. include three replicates of macro-phages extracted from control heart-cell cultures and three replicates that were infected with COVID-19. They can be found in NCBI Database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with the following dataset ID's:
