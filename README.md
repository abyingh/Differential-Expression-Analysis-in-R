COVID - 19 has emerged to be a defining challenge in various aspects of our life in the last year. An increasing amount of studies about the long term effects of exposure to the virus start to alert the public of the concerning consequences of infection to human health. As of 2021, most people are aware of the potential harms of infection with regards to the long term effects on the respiratory system and the brain. Incidents of heart problems after infection have shown the need to explore this relationship: Heart injury has been reported in up to 25 percent of COVID-19 patients, yet the cause of myocardial histopathology is unknown.
